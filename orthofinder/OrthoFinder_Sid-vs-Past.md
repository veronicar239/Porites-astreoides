# Ortholog identification 
## Compare *Porites astreoides* and *Siderastrea sp.* transcriptome assemblies

**Orthologs:**
- genes in different species that evolved from a common ancestral gene
- are thought to retain the same function in the course of evolution

### Orthogroups & Orthologs

**Orthologs** are pairs of genes that descended from a single gene in the last common ancestor (LCA) of two species. 

An orthogroup is the extension of the concept of orthology to groups of species. 
An **orthogroup** is the group of genes descended from a single gene in the LCA of a group of species.

### Why Orthogroups

Orthogroups allow you to analyse all of your data

All of the genes in an orthogroup are descended from a single ancestral gene. Thus, **all the genes in an orthogroup started out with the same sequence and function.** As gene duplication and loss occur frequently in evolution, one-to-one orthologs are rare and limitation of analyses to on-to-one orthologs limits an analysis to a small fraction of the available data. By analysing orthogroups you can analyse all of your data.

##### Orthogroups allow you to define the unit of comparison

It is important to note that with orthogroups you choose where to define the limits of the unit of comparison. For example, if you just chose to analyse human and mouse in the above figure then you would have two orthogroups.
Orthogroups are the only way to identify orthologs.

Orthology is defined by phylogeny. It is not definable by amino acid content, codon bias, GC content or other measures of sequence similarity. Methods that use such scores to define orthologs in the absence of phylogeny can only provide guesses. The only way to be sure that the orthology assignment is correct is by conducting a phylogenetic reconstruction of all genes descended from a single gene the last common ancestor of the species under consideration. This set of genes is an orthogroup. Thus, the only way to define orthology is by analysing orthogroups.


### Method:  OrthoFinder
OrthoFinder is a software program for phylogenetic orthology inference.

It takes as input the proteomes for the species you want to analyse and from these it automatically:

    - infers the orthogroups for your species
    - infers a complete set of rooted gene trees
    - infers a rooted species tree
    - infers all orthology relationships between the genes using the gene trees
    - infers gene duplication events and cross references them to the corresponding nodes on the gene and species trees
    - provides comparative genomics statistics for your species

OrthoFinder uses gene trees. This means you can check every ortholog relationship in the gene tree it came from. The use of gene trees gives very high ortholog inference accuracy. Despite OrthoFinder using a more rigorous, gene-tree based approach to ortholog inference it is incredibly fast.

The default, and fastest, version of OrthoFinder uses DIAMOND [24] for sequence similarity searches. These sequence similarity scores provide both the raw data for orthogroup inference [10] and for gene tree inference of these orthogroups using DendroBLAST [24]. The default implementation of OrthoFinder has been designed to enable a complete analysis with maximum speed and scalability using only gene sequences as input. However, OrthoFinder has also been designed to allow the use of alternative methods for tree inference and sequence search to accommodate user preferences. For example, BLAST [4] can be used for sequence similarity searches in place of DIAMOND. Similarly, gene trees do not need to be inferred using DendroBLAST. Instead, OrthoFinder can automatically infer multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees using most user-preferred multiple sequence alignment and tree inference methods. Moreover, if the species tree is known prior to the analysis, this can also be provided as input, rather than inferred by OrthoFinder.

**BLAST all-v-all algorithm?**


From OrthoFinder best practice webpage:

*One problem that can arise with transcriptomes is when you start with ~100,000 transcripts per species. This can be computationally expensive and will likely result in a very large number of files being generated, so be careful in such cases.*


I decided to run OrthoFinder separately for hosts versus symbionts.

Writing orthogroups to file
---------------------------
OrthoFinder assigned 13060 genes (26.8% of total) to 4319 orthogroups. Fifty percent of all genes were in orthogroups with 1 or more genes (G50 was 1) and were contained in the largest 15581 orthogroups (O50 was 15581). There were 2026 orthogroups with all species present and 1472 of these consisted entirely of single-copy genes.
```

*OrthoFinder note:  In general itâs nice to see at least 80% of your genes assigned to orthogroups. Fewer than this means that you are probably missing orthology relationships that actually exist for some of the remaining genes, poor species sampling is the most likely cause for this.*
...I think this is for organisms that are better sequenced/ annotated than corals...

One of the most common reasons for running OrthoFinder is to find the orthologue of a gene youâre interested in.

Often weâre interested in group-wise species comparisons, that is comparisons across a clade of species rather than between a pair of species. The generalisation of orthology to multiple species is the orthogroup. Just like orthologues are the genes descended from a single gene in the last common ancestor of a pair of species **an orthogroup is the set of genes descended from a single gene in a group of species.** 

Each gene tree from OrthoFinder, for example the one above, is for one orthogroup. The orthogroup gene tree is the tree we need to look at if we want it to include all pairwise orthologues. And even though some of the genes within an orthogroup can be paralogs of one another, if we tried to take any genes out then we would also be removing orthologs too.

So if we want to do a comparison of the âequivalentâ genes in a set of species, we need to do the comparison across the genes in an othogroup. The orthogroups are in the file Orthogroups/Orthogroups.tsv. This table has one orthogroup per line and one spcies per column and is ordered from largest orthogroup to smallest.

Often weâre interested in group-wise species comparisons, that is comparisons across a clade of species rather than between a pair of species. The generalisation of orthology to multiple species is the orthogroup. Just like orthologues are the genes descended from a single gene in the last common ancestor of a pair of species **an orthogroup is the set of genes descended from a single gene in a group of species.** 

Each gene tree from OrthoFinder, for example the one above, is for one orthogroup. The orthogroup gene tree is the tree we need to look at if we want it to include all pairwise orthologues. And even though some of the genes within an orthogroup can be paralogs of one another, if we tried to take any genes out then we would also be removing orthologs too.

So if we want to do a comparison of the âequivalentâ genes in a set of species, we need to do the comparison across the genes in an othogroup. The orthogroups are in the file Orthogroups/Orthogroups.tsv. This table has one orthogroup per line and one spcies per column and is ordered from largest orthogroup to smallest.

For each orthogroup there is a FASTA file in Orthogroup_Sequences/ which contains the sequences for the genes in that orthogroup.

Writing orthogroups to file
---------------------------
OrthoFinder assigned 53080 genes (39.0% of total) to 21527 orthogroups. Fifty percent of all genes were in orthogroups with 1 or more genes (G50 was 1) and were contained in the largest 36505 orthogroups (O50 was 36505). There were 960 orthogroups with all species present and 458 of these consisted entirely of single-copy genes.
